It&#8217;s graduation season, so brace yourself! It&#8217;s time for all the &#8220;Follow Your Passion&trade;&#8221; posts. You&#8217;ll find most of these posts quoting Steve Jobs, assuming you have unlimited time/resources, and coming from positions of privilege. I went through a time where I soaked up these posts. I&#8217;m an Apple user, had no family (at that time), and am a straight white male, so BING-BING-BING &ndash; I was a perfect candidate to join the passion cult!

As appealing as &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; advice sounds (*find a job you love and you&#8217;ll never work a day in your life,* amirite?), that way of looking at work left me more frustrated and discontent than anything else.

## Problems with &#8220;following your passion&#8221;

I personally struggle a lot with &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; advice. I suspect there are a few others who feel the same way, so I hope that talking through my problems will help you as well.

### I have a lot of passions!

I can&#8217;t follow a passion, because I feel like I have too many passions! Which one do I even follow? I sit down and try to focus and figure out what my passion is. I talk with my wife, my family, and my close friends and ask them for input on which passion I should choose. And I don&#8217;t get much clarity. I&#8217;m currently working a job that has nothing to do with my education at all (and I&#8217;ve earned a PhD in that field!) - and I&#8217;m absolutely loving that job. Part of me wonders, what&#8217;s wrong with me? Another part is immensely grateful I&#8217;ve got a good job in a good industry. Yet another part wonders when/if I&#8217;ll put my educational investment to career use. I can&#8217;t follow my passion because I don&#8217;t have just one.

### My passion isn&#8217;t worth money.

One of my passions is pizza. I know, that&#8217;s kind of a dumb passion to most people. In my defense, I&#8217;m not passionate about Pizza Hut or Papa John&#8217;s at all: I do love finding the *really good* local pizza places, the ones with fresh ingredients, creative recipes, and great atmosphere. I love both NY-style and Chicago deep-dish pizza. My wife and I know which pizza places to order which kinds of pizza from: one of our local places has a fantastic fennel sausage, another one has a really good cracked pepper recipe. But&hellip; no one&#8217;s interested in paying me to drive around and eat pizza. Well, no one that I&#8217;m aware of, anyway: if you are, [let me know](/contact/). I&#8217;ve pursued other ways of making money ([printable](http://jamesandaudreyjo.com) [art](https://www.etsy.com/shop/JamesAndAudreyJo), [wedding sites](http://weddings.jamessteinbach.com), [freelance web dev](http://summitws.com)) that haven&#8217;t panned out. That&#8217;s not to say I lost my shirt on them; they just didn&#8217;t turn out to be stable enough to support my family. A lot of my passions make great hobbies or side projects, but not sustainable careers. I can&#8217;t follow my passion because not every passion pays the bills.

### My passions change really frequently.

I&#8217;ve got a passionate and somewhat distractable personality. I find a new &#8220;favorite thing&#8221; and pursue it hard for &hellip; it depends: a few weeks, sometimes months, occasionally years. I don&#8217;t think this is bad. Honestly, it&#8217;s a lot of fun diving into something new, learning the heck out of it, and then repeating that process with something else in a few months. But I&#8217;m also realistic: I can&#8217;t build a career on the subject of one of those passions! (I mean, with as many tools and technologies as there are in web development, I&#8217;m probably in an OK field for this.) I can&#8217;t follow my passion because they change too often.

## Some better advice&hellip;

Since &#8220;Follow Your Passion&#8221; doesn&#8217;t always work, I&#8217;ve thought through some alternate bits of advice. Here are some of the principles I follow as I think about career choices, passion, and long-range plans.

### Focus on providing value to others.

There&#8217;s a degree to which &#8220;follow your passion&#8221; can be really selfish advice. Not necessarily malicious or arrogant advice, but self-focused and potentially self-consumed. It&#8217;s easy to let a focus on *my* passion cloud my ability to think about others and practice humility. At the same time, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of satisfaction to be found in serving the needs of others. Rather than making career decisions based on &#8220;what am I passionate about?&#8221;, try thinking through the question &#8220;what can I do to provide value to others?&#8221; If you can be content spending your time working at a job you know provides real value to people around you, you&#8217;re in a good place to let go of pursuing illusive &#8220;passion.&#8221;

Personally, some of the worst frustration I&#8217;ve felt at work has been when I was doing the kind of work *I* really enjoyed, but I wasn&#8217;t convinced I was doing anything to contribute anything truly meaningful to the world. We all have a different idea of what makes work &#8220;truly meaningful&#8221; or what constitutes &#8220;providing real value&#8221; and that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;d suggest that providing value to others is at least as good a reason to pursue a career path as following your passion.

### Make time for passions on the side.

Like I mentioned earlier, some passions would make bad careers, but they&#8217;re awesome hobbies. If one of my friends asks about wedding invitations and a matching site, I&#8217;ll look for some weekend time to carve out for that. If I get an idea for a new print to put on Etsy, I&#8217;ll take an evening or two to work on it. I treat these &#8220;side-passions&#8221; like pizza or cheesecake: I love them and I want to enjoy them regularly, but it really wouldn&#8217;t work out well for me if I were to have them full-time.

It&#8217;s important to have creative outlets, to make time for fun projects, to have a weekend/evening thing. Especially if you feel like your passions won&#8217;t make you any money. This puts them in a place where they don&#8217;t have to be judged on their financial viability; you can simply enjoy them for what they are.

### Plan to grow and change.

This advice is particularly for you if your passions change frequently, but it works for most other as well. Most of us aren&#8217;t statues. We&#8217;re not static characters; our default is to be changing constantly. So plan for that.

In job interviews, you can be up-front about this: &#8220;I&#8217;m an incredibly nimble learner. I pick up new tools and tasks quickly and easily. I love to do the kind of work that gives me freedom to explore and grow.&#8221; There are probably some interviewers who won&#8217;t know what to do with that transparency, but I bet there are a lot who would love to know they have someone like that on their team. And as a side note, if that&#8217;s you, you won&#8217;t be happy working for someone who expects to manage a bunch of automatons, so a rejection from him is a win-win.

## Conclusion

&#8220;Follow Your Passion&trade;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work for everyone or in every situation. There are some legitimate reasons that following a passion may not be right for you. If you find yourself juggling multiple passions, struggling to see how a passion can support you, or shifting passions frequently, you&#8217;re just fine. Instead of trying to bend your life and personality to passion advice, consider factors that work better for you. Look for work that gives you satisfaction that you&#8217;re providing value to others. Keep your &#8220;unprofitable&#8221; passions around for side projects and hobbies and enjoy them. Plan for inevitable growth and changes; look for a job where being nimble is an asset.
