  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I&#39;m available to work on projects in any of my areas of expertise: CSS, Sass, accessibility, user experience (UX), workflow automation, performance, and WordPress development. (More info about <a href="/hire/">my areas of expertise</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h2>
<p>I can <strong>build new sites</strong>: WordPress themes, flat-file sites, even static site generators (like Jekyll, Metalsmith, or Harp).</p>
<p>I can <strong>refactor your code</strong>. With time, codebases get really bloated. Every dev adds code in their own style; everyone&#39;s afraid something will go wrong if they delete some existing code. If your team isn&#39;t able to clean up the code base (not a slam on them: there&#39;s no shame in recognizing technical limitations or time constraints!), I can refactor it (and provide rules for future code) so they can work more quickly and happily.</p>
<p>I can <strong>optimize your site</strong>. If your site was built without proper consideration for speed, accessibility, mobile usability or user experience, I can strengthen its weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-do-it">How I Do It</h2>
<p>Based on your requirements, I&#39;ll provide you a <strong>single project price</strong>. If that&#39;s a surprise to you, keep reading. (If not, enjoy the next paragraph!) If I billed hourly and gave you an hourly estimate, we&#39;d end up in trouble if something unexpected pushes the project past that estimate. Either you&#39;d pay more than you expected to get it finished, or I&#39;d deliver the project in its current state. And the whole time, we&#39;d be inefficient. You&#39;d want to make sure I could justify every hour logged; I&#39;d use up valuable hours tracking and reporting the time I spend - it wouldn&#39;t be great. A flat project rate lines our goals up perfectly, however. You get a solid price that doesn&#39;t change.</p>
<p>Based on your requirements, I&#39;ll also provide you a <strong>contract and a completion estimate</strong>. The estimate where some of our flexibility lives. If you&#39;re still collecting resources (design comps, style guide, 3rd party integration information, etc), I&#39;ll provide a duration estimate and we&#39;ll wait together till everything&#39;s ready for work to begin. If you&#39;ve got everything ready to go, we&#39;ll document the project requirements and get started.</p>
<p>While the project progresses, we&#39;ll schedule a <strong>weekly check-in</strong>. I&#39;ll brief you on what I&#39;ve got done so far, let you know what I&#39;m going after next, and make sure you&#39;re aware of any blockers that are preventing my progress. This isn&#39;t a big screenshare/show-and-tell/demo meeting (unless, of course, visual design is part of the project); it&#39;s usually less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>As I work, if any <em>new requirements arise or significant scope changes are requested</em> (since we agreed on those already and attached them to the contract, it&#39;ll be easy to confirm), I&#39;ll immediately inform you how those surprises affect the completion estimate. We&#39;ll talk about how those affect the project rate and the completion estimate. More than likely, we&#39;ll draw up a contract amendment that documents the scope change, new requirements, and price change.</p>
<p>When we agree on the project price and completion estimate, we&#39;ll sign everything up and start. I require 70% of the fee upfront, with the other 30% due after delivery. If there&#39;s a price increase due to changes made to the requirements and scope, 100% of that increase will be due when that amendment is signed. The simplicity of that payment method and the percentages due are designed to reflect mutual trust. I feel comfortable asking for a significant portion in advance because I believe my value is visible. Even if we&#39;ve never met before, by the time we get to signing the contract, I want you to be confident that I&#39;m a professional with deep expertise. The 70% upfront fee demonstrates that you trust the value I&#39;m providing. My willingness to deliver the project before getting the final dollar shows my trust for you. I used to use contracts that withheld final deliverables till after the final payment. I&#39;ve seen that turn the final delivery into a bit of an awkward hostage exchange.</p>
