## Reference Sites

### [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)*

If you haven't blocked w3schools from your search results, please do. Instead, use MDN. It's a fantastic resource for looking up almost anything in HTML, CSS & JS and getting an accurate, organized description of what it does.

### [CSS-Tricks Almanac](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/)

Look up any CSS property and get a useful description of what values it takes and what it does.

### [CSS Guidelines](http://cssguidelin.es/)*

This is a great guideline for writing clean, maintainable CSS. It's a guideline, not a law, but in my opinion, it's largely worth following.

### [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/)*

Just like CSS Guidelines, but for Sass.

### [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)*

Look up any CSS, HTML5, SVG or browser API property and see what browsers support it (and which ones need prefixes or fallbacks).

### [WebsiteSetup](https://websitesetup.org/)

This introduction to setting up your first website covers all the topics you'll need: hosting, domains, CMSes and more. It focuses most on WordPress.

### [Sass Docs](http://sass-lang.com/)*

Everything you need to know about Sass. I learn something new every time I come here.

### [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/)

Invaluable for WP developers. Get all the details on core functions, actions & filters.

## Courses
