<img class="alignleft" src="/images/headshot.png" alt="James Steinbach: Profile Photo" width="200" height="174" style="shape-outside:url(/images/headshot.png);shape-margin:1em;"/>I&#8217;m a Chicago native currently enjoying the mountains of Denver after a long sojourn in the Carolinas. When I&#8217;m not building websites, I love to read Clancy, Crichton, Baldacci, etc. I&#8217;m usually up for a good laugh: Brooklyn 99, Mindy Project, Tonight Show, Late Show. Time with [my wife Audrey][1] & [newborn daughter][2] is always a delight. And I rarely say no to fantastic food &amp; drink.

When I am building websites, I love developing clever animations: motion is one of the best ways to delight users and help them understand their interaction with content. I want to make content accessible to every user, so responsive design is a must. I also want to keep things organized for future me or future developers, so I&#8217;m using Sass/PostCSS to keep styles clean and light.

I don&#8217;t just like building sites, I love sharing the things I&#8217;m learning as I build. I keep lots of [demos on CodePen][3]. [I write][4] about what I learn. I&#8217;m an experienced conference speaker and client trainer. Please [let me know][5] if I can help you!
