About 8 tweets into a (loving) Twitter rant this afternoon, I thought, &#8220;I wish I had a platform where I could write as many characters as I want and share that with the world!&#8221; So here we are. <a title="My Twitter Rant" href="https://twitter.com/jdsteinbach/status/524234850702991360" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s my rant</a>:

  * [Insert any generic development topic] with WordPress is somehow a valid category of articles these days…
  * It’s not like animation, grids layouts, CSS prefixes, or font choice are somehow different in WP than any other platform.
  * There are a few cases where WP has a quirk or specific implementation requirement, but not THAT often.
  * Are WP devs/users just afraid to click on any dev tutorial that doesn’t include “with WordPress” in the title?
  * If so, I think we as a community need to grow and start thinking through the right ways to implement normal dev techniques in WP sites.
  * This should cause a distinction in the WP “dev” community between actually developers and theme tweakers. I would welcome that distinction.
  * All that to say: WP Devs, let’s look around and participate in the broader development community, not just our comfortable WP circles.
  * Got a great dev technique? Just write about it, no “with WordPress” needed.
  * The more we contribute to the larger dev community, the less we’ll be treated like the weird kid eating glue in the corner.
  * Using WordPress is great in many situations, but let’s be bigger than our tools.
  * // end rant // clicks “new post”

## [Title] + &#8220;in WordPress&#8221;

I write occasionally about WordPress development and I read a lot about it too. I&#8217;ve been noticing a trend lately that I find frustrating: articles that take take a normal development technique and add &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; to the end. Sometimes that&#8217;s necessary. I&#8217;ve written about using Sass for WP Development: there are a couple of WP-specific considerations that need to be pointed out.

Sometimes, however, the topic is so generic that appending &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; isn&#8217;t helpful. &#8220;CSS Animations&#8221;in WordPress! Nope. There&#8217;s no WP-specific way to write CSS keyframes. Why would an article like that be written? (I have a suspicion and it includes reasons like &#8220;SEO keyword targeting&#8221; and &#8220;borderline clickbait&#8221; but I don&#8217;t want to cast this as an accusation &#8211; just some cynicism.) At any rate, unless there&#8217;s a uniquely WP way that a technique should be implemented, there&#8217;s not need for a uniquely WP article about it.

I wonder if we (as a WordPress community) have trained ourselves and our newcomers to always want a &#8220;WordPress version&#8221; of every development technique. Regardless of the reasons for unnecessarily adding &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; to development posts, I think it&#8217;s successful because so many people are trained to add &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; to their search queries. Always wanting tutorials for &#8220;[Do X] in WordPress&#8221; means that you miss an awful lot of fantastic articles and tutorials about X that don&#8217;t happen to mention WordPress.

## Looking Outside of the WP Community

We need to change this bias. Developers who use WordPress should start looking outside of WordPress to learn development techniques. Subscribe to some general <a title="Front-End Web Development Resources" href="http://jamessteinbach.com/css/front-end-web-development-resources/" target="_blank">development blogs and newsletters</a>. Go to some conferences that aren&#8217;t WordCamps. Drop &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; from your internet search queries. Take the time to learn from the broader development community, then discerningly implement what you&#8217;ve learned in your WP projects.

I realize that with this emphasis on participating in the broader development community is going to force a wedge between actual developers who use WordPress and WordPress users who tweak theme and call that development. I am 100% in favor of amplifying such a distinction. I&#8217;m not advocating a mean-spirited &#8220;us (real devs) vs. them (theme tweakers)&#8221; prejudice or bullying. I do want to see those of us who are actual developers to start leading in actual development circles: then let the distinction take care of itself.

## Contributing Outside of the WP Community

So let&#8217;s drop the &#8220;in WordPress&#8221; when appropriate and start writing &#8220;normal&#8221; development posts. Let&#8217;s get serious about attending (and speaking at) normal meetups and conferences. Let&#8217;s find languages, tools, and causes to champion &#8211; outside of the WordPress bubble.

There&#8217;s a stigma that WP developers sometimes bear in the development world. We&#8217;re treated as &#8220;almost developers&#8221; or &#8220;not quite real developers.&#8221; If PHP takes flack for being [whatever people like griping about at the moment], WP more so. The way to change that perception is not sulking, hiding, or reverse snarkism. The way to change negative perception of WordPress developers is to participate and contribute like &#8220;real developers.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to stay in a comfortable corner; it&#8217;s hard putting your work (and yourself!) out for criticism.

I&#8217;m not denigrating WordPress here &#8211; please don&#8217;t hear that in this rant. WP is a great tool &#8211; I use it all the time for several substantial reasons. I&#8217;m also not recommending that we hide &#8220;WordPress&#8221; from LinkedIn endorsements or remove it from our blog categories. It&#8217;s really useful and we should use it without shame. We need to make sure we&#8217;re not defining ourselves by that tool, however. Let&#8217;s define ourselves as good developers and use whatever tools work best.

Let&#8217;s be bigger than our tools.
