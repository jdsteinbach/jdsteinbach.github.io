I've seen a few other devs (like [Wes](https://wesbos.com/uses/) &amp; [Elijah](http://elijahmanor.com/uses/)) post about the tools they use and thought I'd share some details about my setup. Hopefully it's helpful to you!

## Software
* I write code in [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/). I've tried Atom & VS Code recently but still prefer ST3. I use the [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) &amp; its color scheme. I'm using the [IBM Plex Mono font](https://www.ibm.com/plex/). Some of my plugins are specific to the languages I use regularly, but several are useful for any developer: [A File Icon](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/A%20File%20Icon), [BracketHighlighter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BracketHighlighter), [Emmet](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Emmet), [SideBarEnhancements](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements), [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TrailingSpaces), and [TrailingSpaces](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TrailingSpaces).
* I don't do much design, but I love when designers hand off files in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). I've worked with [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) and it's not bad either.
* I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal. I'm using [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) there too, with [my own color scheme](https://gist.github.com/jdsteinbach/b57a5651b831d6161bbdd20396cfe33a#file-jdsteinbach-itermcolors). In iTerm, I use [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) with [my own custom prompt](https://gist.github.com/jdsteinbach/b57a5651b831d6161bbdd20396cfe33a#file-jdsteinbach-zsh-theme)
* I love [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and have the Powerpack license.

## Physical
* I work from a MacBook Pro. When I'm home, it's hooked up to two external monitors: one portrait (for code and documents) and one landscape.
* I built a [custom standing desk](https://github.com/jdsteinbach/open-source-office/issues/1) from various shelves and other pieces from IKEA. It looks a bit basic, but everything matches nicely ad it's just what I need.
* I stand on a [Topo Anti-Fatigue Mat](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V3TO9HW/) by ErgoDriven, and wear [Spenco Supreme Slippers](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJ771J8/) with arch support. Sometimes I like to sit for a bit, and I bought a cheap [tall stool](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K4D2K96/) for that.
* I like music, and listen to on [Pioneer SP-BS22-LR Bookshelf Speakers](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B008NCD2LG/) driven by [this amp](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TUSXEY/). I also use [Airpods](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) for calls/meetings and [Audio Technica ATH-M35 Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00242J0XU/) when I need to block background noise more.
