# Site Generator: jdsteinbach.com

I'm using [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/) to compile Markdown, render Liquid templates, and build my blog. It's a lot like Jekyll, but it runs in JS. That's lighter & quicker for me.

This project uses an Eleventy template file to process CSS (Sass & PostCSS).

I'll work on some posts (eventually) on how I converted this over, & what you might want to know if you're considering converting from Jekyll, or setting up an 11ty site.
